# System Verilog Lab 

## Overview
This repository contains lab projects completed as part of a System Verilog course. The labs focus on designing and implementing state machines, connecting components in Quartus, and running code on an FPGA board. The final project is a game similar to Road Fighter.

## Introduction
System Verilog is a powerful hardware description and verification language used for designing and simulating electronic systems. This lab series provides hands-on experience with System Verilog, Quartus, and FPGA boards, culminating in the development of a simple game similar to Road Fighter.

## Projects

### State Machines
In this lab, we designed and implemented various state machines using System Verilog. State machines are essential for controlling sequential logic in digital systems.

### Component Integration in Quartus
This lab focused on connecting different hardware components in Quartus to build complex systems. We learned how to integrate modules, handle pin assignments, and simulate the design.

### FPGA Implementation
In this lab, we programmed an FPGA board to run our System Verilog code. We verified the functionality of our designs by observing the behavior on the FPGA hardware.


### Road Fighter Game
The final project involved creating a game similar to Road Fighter. We implemented the game logic, graphics, and controls using System Verilog and ran it on an FPGA board.
